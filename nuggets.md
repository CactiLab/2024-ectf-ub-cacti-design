# Nuggets

## Overview
Oftentimes, a bit of information might be useful to one or more people but
there's not a great place to store that information. Even a passing thought
can have value if it's written down and shared with other people.

This document aims to collect those "nuggets" of information that might benefit
someone else if they were written down. Nuggets can come from your imagination,
something you read online, a conversation you had, or even a sign that you saw
on your way in. The point is to write it down and see what happens.

There is no need to associate your name with a nugget. Doing so allows us to
discuss more in-depth about that particular piece of information, but having
an anonymous nugget is better than having no nugget! There's no hard-and-fast
organizational rules for this document, but try to keep it clean and try to
keep nuggets separated.

If your nugget came from a definitive source (i.e., website or paper), **please**
**cite that source**! Not only is this fair attribution, but it gives everyone
else the opportunity to delve deeper into the topic.
