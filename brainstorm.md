# Brainstorm

## Overview
This document is a place to write down any ideas you have related to the 2024
eCTF. If you think an idea is ‘crazy’ or infeasible, put it here anyways!
There’s no requirement to attach your name to an idea, but doing so allows us
to have a conversation about it and to determine how well it will fit into the
project’s goals.

Documents like this are important because not everyone feels comfortable or has
the opportunity to speak up during meetings. Even ideas that might not be
feasible on their own have value because they influence the thought process of
other people. The exchange of ideas often leads to unique and unpredictable
places!

Feel free to contribute to this document without prior permission. The only rule
is to **please not delete anyone else’s ideas**. If you’d like to, you can add a
stylized comment, like so:

> **Comment** This is a great idea! I think if we did Y instead of X, it might
> match our project goals more closely.


## Ideas
Put your ideas here! Try to add a brief, descriptive title as heading-3 (###)
followed by an explanation of your idea. You can follow the "Example Idea"
template below.

### Example Idea
#### Overview
The moon is too far away for me to see its surface clearly, and I can't afford a
telescope. Instead, I propose that we tie all the rope together, lasso the moon,
and pull it closer.

#### For
* If we pull the moon closer, it'll be easier to fly there
* This would be an excellent way to unite people across the globe
* There's no gravity in space, so we only need to get the lasso off the ground!

#### Against
* It's unclear if we have enough rope to reach the moon
* Earth's gravity might be too strong for the rope to escape
* It would be a *really big* lasso

#### Comments
> **Comment** This is cool! Do you think people would be willing to donate their rope?\
> **Comment** I prefer the moon where it is ...\
> **Comment** Can you explain what a lasso is?
