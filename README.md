## Contributing
All contributions should be discussed with the team leaders before any effort
is put into them. This is to ensure that a contributor does not spend time on
a contribution only to have it rejected in the future.

All code contributions **must** be created on a separate branch and merged into
`main` with a pull request. Only the team leaders can review and approve pull
requests.

As a contributor, you will have access to everything in the repository. Please
take special care to leave things in the condition that you found them. I.e.,
do not arbitrarily change documents, `.gitignore` rules, folder / file structure,
etc. without first confirming the changes with the team leaders.
